Key Differences from Original Plan
Build-Test-Verify Loop: Each module includes immediate data import and verification, ensuring everything works before moving forward.
Realistic Test Data: Instead of minimal test data, you're building a substantial test database with intentionally planted patterns that demonstrate the system's value.
Progressive Complexity: Start with simple entities (companies), then add relationships, building complexity gradually while maintaining a working system.
Demo-Ready Output: By the end, you have a fully populated test database that can demonstrate real fraud detection capabilities, not just empty endpoints.
Documentation as You Go: Each module includes documentation, preventing the common problem of undocumented APIs.
